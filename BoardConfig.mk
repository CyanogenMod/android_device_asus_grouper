# This file sets variables that control the way modules are built
# thorughout the system. It should not be used to conditionally
# disable makefiles (the proper mechanism to control what gets
# included in a build is to use PRODUCT_PACKAGES in a product
# definition file).

# WARNING: This line must come *before* including the proprietary
# variant, so that it gets overwritten by the parent (which goes
# against the traditional rules of inheritance).
# The proprietary variant sets USE_CAMERA_STUB := false, this way
# we use the camera stub when the vendor tree isn't present, and
# the true camera library when the vendor tree is available.  Similarly,
# we set USE_PROPRIETARY_AUDIO_EXTENSIONS to true in the proprietary variant as
# well.
